# Weather Data REST API

This Python application provides historical weather data from various stations across Europe. It is built using the Flask framework and offers a REST API for users to access weather information.

## Features

1. **Webpage Documentation:**
   - The app includes a main webpage in HTML that explains how it works.
   - Users can visit this page to understand the app's functionality and usage.
   - This page displays the names of available stations.

2. **Data Retrieval via URL:**
   - Users can search for weather data by station number using the app's URL.
   - If a user enters a specific station number, the REST API will return all available data (including temperature) for that station.

3. **Search by Year:**
   - Users can also search for weather data by specifying both the station number and a particular year.
   - The REST API will provide data for that station during the specified year.

4. **Specific Date Search:**
   - For more granular queries, users can search for a specific date along with the station number.
   - The REST API will return the temperature that particular day.

   - Or `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/yearly/{station_number}/{year}`
   - Or `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/{station_number}`
   - Replace `{station_number}`, `{year}`, and `{date}` with the desired values.
